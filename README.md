Background Image Carousel:
========
Create a web page with two elements.  A default background image that fits the viewport, and a dropdown select box horizontally and vertically centered in the viewport.  Each option in the dropdown is associated with a set of 4 different replacement background images that are cycled through at 5 second intervals when the option is selected.  The dropdown select box should maintain a vertically and horizontally centered position across landscape and portrait screen orientations.
Use native JavaScript in your implementation, and think through the performance implications and FOUC edge cases (if any) of your design.
Send us your code and the url for the web page.  Feel free to add notes on any interesting design choices that you made.

Bonus Points:
========
Make the page responsive so that it works on  IPad and IPhone form factors in both portrait and landscape mode.
